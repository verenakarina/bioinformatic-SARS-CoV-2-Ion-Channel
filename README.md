# bioinformatic-SARS-CoV-2-Ion-Channel

* This is a part of my summer project as a bioinformatics research assistant in Assoc Prof Konstantin Pervushin Lab, NTU School of Biological Science.
* This repo contains files and dataset I used to obtain multiple sequence alignment of E protein of SARS-Cov-2.
* There are 4 clades that were observed: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Final alignments are in txt format located on the main branch.
* Major contributor for the MATLAB code: Assoc Prof Konstantin Pervushin.
* Deepest gratitude to Reema Alag as the research fellow who helped me along the way.
