# bioinformatic-SARS-CoV-2-Ion-Channel

This repo contains files and dataset I used to obtain multiple sequence alignment of E protein of SARS-Cov-2.
There are 4 clades that were observed: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.
This is a part of my summer project as a bioinformatics research assistant in Assoc Prof Konstantin Pervushin, NTU School of Biological Science.
Major contributor for the MATLAB code: Assoc Prof Konstantin Pervushin.
Deepest gratitude to Reema Alag as a research fellow who helped me along the way.
